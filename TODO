* rewrite namespace and description writers
* rewrite family, include, and inheritParam processors
* complete
* run tests
* convert modifyTag to S4
* need tests for multiple tags in a single block

# Bundles

A bundle represents a list of blocks, and how they should be processed (represented by a Processor)

Bundles take care of sourcing the code appropriately, breaking the source code into blocks and then processing each block. Need the following types of bundle:

* package
* directory
* file
* text block

# Extension

Extension of roxygen3 should be through adding new tags, new processors and new writers. It is not desirable for extensions to work "invisibly" - i.e. it is ok to demand that if you want to use an extension you must manually specify a tag, a processor or a writer.

# S4 usage questions

Do you try to ensure that class names are unique?

1. setClass("Animal")
2. setClass("MyPackageAnimal")

How do you name subclasses?

setClass("Animal")

1. setClass("AnimalChicken", contains = "Animal")
2. setClass("ChickenAnimal", contains = "Animal")
3. setClass("Chicken", contains = "Animal")

How do you create a new class?

1. new("Chicken", name = "Andy")

2. # Or create a constructor function and do:
Chicken("Andy")
